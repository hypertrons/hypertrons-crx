## Quickstart

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hypertrons/hypertrons-crx.git
cd hypertrons-crx
npm install
```

Then you can try `npm run start` and visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000` to see some popup pages and options pages.

```bash
npm run start
```

If you want to run and test the whole extension, try the following commands:

```bash
npm run watch
npm run web-ext
```

[web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) would open `Chrome` and load `Hypertrons-crx` into the browser automatically. And the deault configuration of `web-ext` can be found in [package.json](https://github.com/hypertrons/hypertrons-crx/blob/master/package.json):

```json
{
  "webExt": {
      "sourceDir": "distribution",
      "run": {
        "keepProfileChanges": true,
        "chromiumProfile": "./test/web-ext-profile",
        "startUrl": [
          "https://github.com/"
        ]
