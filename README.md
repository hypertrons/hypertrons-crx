### Welcome information

In the first `div` of the `hypertrons-mini-dashboard`, you can setup your own welcome information to developers visit your front page. The default information is `Hello, ${user-login}, welcome to ${repo-name}. You are ${role} of this repo.`.

### Dashboard

There are two kinds of default dashboard components supported, `line chart` and `table`.

#### Line chart

We use simple `echarts` library to support chart functions. So you can refer to `echarts` documentation to checkout how to use it to customize your own charts.

You can set simple data to `line chart` to get a default dashboard component.

#### Table

You can set simple data to `table` component to get a default dashboard component.

### Commandline

After user setup his platform token, the `commandline` will turn on. User can use commandline to send valid command to Hypertrons backend to interact with other platforms or automation process.
